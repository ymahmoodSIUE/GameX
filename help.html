<header>Space Invaders
    <pre>    The object of the game is, basically, to shoot the invaders with
    your laser base while avoiding their shots and preventing an invasion. You can
    move your space ship by using the four arrow keys, and you may use your cannon
    by pressing down on the space bar. Each game screen starts with five rows of 11 invaders.
    The bottom 2 rows score 10 points per large invader, the middle 2 rows 20 points for
    each medium invader and the top row scores 30 points for each small invader.
    This makes each screen worth a total of 990 points. The score for each screen can be
    dramatically increased by the tactical destruction of the 'mystery' value spaceships
    that frequently fly from one side of the screen to the other. Temporary sanctuary can be
    sought beneath the 4 base shelters.

<header>Tetris
    <pre>    Tetris is a very simple game, but can test anybody's geometry skills.  Here
    is how it works: A 2-dimensional block will fall from the sky.  You must place it
    somewhere using the right and left arrow keys.  The down key can be used to make it
    fall faster.  Another block will fall, and that one must also be placed somewhere.
    The catch is that the canvas is only a certain width, and there isn't room for every
    block that falls.  So, you must not waste any space.  The dimensions of each block are
    different.  Some look like an L, some look like cubes, and some are just straight.
    Filling up a row with blocks will result in that row disappearing.  If you stack your
    blocks to where they are falling from, you lose.  Getting rid of rows will help you
    last longer.
